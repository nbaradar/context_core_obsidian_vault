Ranking contexts by **relevance score** based on **embeddings** or **metadata** is not only possible but also a well-established approach in **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** workflows and search systems. It makes perfect sense in the context of **ContextWeave** to ensure that only the most relevant and valuable information is injected into the query. Here’s a detailed explanation:

---
### **How Context Ranking Works**

#### **1. Using Embeddings**
- **Embedding Vectors**:
    - Each stored context and the user’s query are converted into dense vector representations using an embedding model (e.g., OpenAI's `text-embedding-ada-002` or SentenceTransformers models).
    - These embeddings capture semantic meaning, allowing for similarity-based ranking.
- **Relevance Scoring**:
    - Compute the **cosine similarity** (or other similarity metrics) between the query embedding and each context embedding.
    - Contexts with higher similarity scores are deemed more relevant.
- **Workflow Example**:
    1. Convert the query to an embedding vector.
    2. Compute similarity scores for all stored contexts.
    3. Sort contexts by score and select the top N.

#### **2. Using Metadata**
- **Tag-Based Filtering**:
    - Metadata tags like `"health"`, `"diet"`, or `"finance"` can be used to pre-filter contexts before computing embeddings.
    - Example: A query about “healthy recipes” retrieves contexts tagged with `"health"` and `"diet"` before applying embedding-based ranking.
- **Custom Relevance Rules**:
    - Additional scoring based on metadata such as:
        - Recency: Newer contexts may score higher for time-sensitive queries.
        - User-Specific Tags: Prioritize contexts flagged as important by the user.

### **Does Ranking Contexts Make Sense?**
Yes, ranking contexts by relevance is highly logical and aligns with several goals:
#### **1. Improves Response Accuracy**
- Only the most relevant contexts are injected into the query, reducing the likelihood of irrelevant or misleading responses from the LLM.
#### **2. Token Optimization**
- LLMs have token limits, so injecting only high-value contexts ensures that token space is used effectively.
#### **3. Personalization**
- A ranking system can incorporate user preferences or context importance to tailor responses further.
#### **4. Efficiency**
- Ranking allows the system to scale effectively, especially when dealing with large datasets.

### **Example Scenario: Query Ranking in Action**
#### **Scenario**:
The user queries: _“What are some good recipes for weight loss?”_
#### **Steps**:
1. **Generate Query Embedding**:
    - Convert the query into an embedding vector using an embedding model.
2. **Filter by Metadata**:
    - Retrieve all contexts tagged with `["health", "diet", "recipes"]`.
3. **Compute Similarity Scores**:
    - Compare the query embedding with the embeddings of filtered contexts:
        - Context 1: “Vegetarian Mediterranean diet for weight loss” → Similarity: 0.85
        - Context 2: “Low-carb recipes for diabetics” → Similarity: 0.75
        - Context 3: “Desserts with low sugar” → Similarity: 0.45
4. **Rank by Relevance**:
    - Sort contexts by similarity score:
        - 1st: Context 1 (0.85)
        - 2nd: Context 2 (0.75)
5. **Inject Top Contexts**:
    - Inject the most relevant contexts (e.g., top 2) into the query sent to the LLM.

---
### **Practical Considerations**
#### **1. Pre-Filtering with Metadata**
- Pre-filtering by tags or categories reduces computational load by limiting the number of contexts to rank.
#### **2. Balance Between Embeddings and Metadata**
- Metadata provides explicit filtering, while embeddings allow for nuanced, semantic relevance scoring.
- Combining both ensures robustness.
#### **3. Thresholds and Limits**
- Define thresholds for relevance scores to exclude low-relevance contexts.
- Set a maximum number of contexts (e.g., top 5) to inject into the query to stay within token limits.

### **Technologies to Implement This**
1. **Embedding Models**:
    - OpenAI’s `text-embedding-ada-002` for high-quality embeddings.
    - SentenceTransformers (e.g., `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) for local, open-source solutions.
2. **Vector Databases**:
    - **Pinecone**, **Weaviate**, or **FAISS** to store embeddings and perform similarity search efficiently.
3. **Scoring and Ranking Logic**:
    - Use libraries like `numpy` or `scipy` for similarity calculations.
    - Example: Cosine similarity for ranking.

### **Example Code**
Here’s a Python example of ranking contexts:

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer, util
import numpy as np

# Example contexts and query
contexts = [
    {"id": 1, "text": "Vegetarian Mediterranean diet for weight loss", "tags": ["health", "diet"]},
    {"id": 2, "text": "Low-carb recipes for diabetics", "tags": ["health", "diet"]},
    {"id": 3, "text": "Desserts with low sugar", "tags": ["health", "diet", "recipes"]}
]
query = "What are some good recipes for weight loss?"

# Load embedding model
model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

# Generate embeddings
query_embedding = model.encode(query)
context_embeddings = [model.encode(context["text"]) for context in contexts]

# Compute similarity scores
scores = [util.cos_sim(query_embedding, emb).item() for emb in context_embeddings]

# Rank contexts by score
ranked_contexts = sorted(zip(contexts, scores), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

# Select top N contexts
top_contexts = ranked_contexts[:2]

# Print results
for context, score in top_contexts:
    print(f"Context: {context['text']} - Score: {score}")
```
