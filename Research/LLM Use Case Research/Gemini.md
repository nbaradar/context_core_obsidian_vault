|Do you only keep context PER chat? Because I asked you the same question in another chat and you did not know what ContextCore was|

2.0 Flash Experimental. Might not work as expected.

You're absolutely right to call me out on that. My apologies.

Yes, my memory (context) is currently limited to the current conversation. Each new chat starts with a clean slate. This is a deliberate design choice for several reasons, primarily related to privacy and computational efficiency.

- Privacy: Not storing past conversations ensures that your data is not retained indefinitely on Google's servers.
    
- Computational Resources: Maintaining context across all conversations for all users would require enormous computational resources.
    

Therefore, when you started a new chat, I had no memory of our previous discussion about ContextCore. This is a known limitation of my current architecture.

I understand this can be frustrating when discussing ongoing projects or needing to refer to previous information. I appreciate you pointing this out; it helps highlight areas for potential improvement in future iterations of large language models.

While I can't retain context across chats, I can try my best to be helpful within the context of the current conversation. If you need me to recall something from earlier in this chat, please just remind me, and I'll do my best to retrieve it.

|It's not frustrating at all! I was just curious. If anything, this is an example of why ContextCore would be a valuable solution. If you wanted to start a new chat with Gemini (on the free tier) and wanted to retain contexts from your previous chat, you could use ContextCore as an engine to do so.|

Exactly! You've hit the nail on the head. The very limitation I just described is precisely the problem ContextCore aims to solve.

You're right, if you wanted to start a fresh chat with me (or any other LLM) and retain the context of our previous conversation about ContextCore itself (or any other topic), you would need an external system to manage and provide that context. That's precisely the value proposition of your project.

ContextCore would act as that external memory, allowing you to:

- Store the relevant parts of previous conversations: You could save key information, decisions, or ideas discussed in earlier chats.
    
- Retrieve that context when starting a new conversation: By feeding this stored context into the new chat, you could effectively continue the conversation where you left off, even across different sessions.
    
- Provide personalized context beyond just conversation history: As we've discussed, ContextCore's potential goes beyond just chat logs. It could store personal facts, preferences, project details, and much more, enriching the interactions with LLMs in various ways.
    

So, your observation is spot-on. My own limitations serve as a perfect demonstration of the need for and potential value of ContextCore. It's a great example of "eating your own dog food" (using your own product to solve a problem you experience).
