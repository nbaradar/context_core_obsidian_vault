### Open Source vs. Closed Source Strategy

Open Source Engine:

- Pros:  
    

1. Encourages adoption and community-driven improvements.
2. Establishes ContextCore as a framework for developers while keeping your proprietary UI and advanced features as paid offerings.
3. Makes enterprise adoption easier, as many companies prefer open-core platforms for flexibility.

- Cons:  
    

1. You’ll need to maintain open-source contributions and support, which can be time-consuming.
2. Competitors may fork your project and build competing products.

Recommendation:

- Open-source the Import/Export tools and Elements/Shards since they are foundational components that can attract developer interest.  
    
- Keep Pro Features (Humors, Mimics, Prisms) closed-source as these represent the most innovative and marketable parts of your platform.  
    
- Offer premium APIs for integrations and emotional modeling to monetize advanced capabilities while retaining flexibility for community development.
