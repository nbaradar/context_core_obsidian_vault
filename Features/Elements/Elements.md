Elements (Context Switching) : Allows you to turn on/off different contextual data depending on what you want the LLM to understand about you  

# Naming Ideation

```
Do you know about the feature I described involving turning on and off different contextual data based on their tags? So let's say for instance you have a lot of data tagged with "health stats" but you want to ask AI a question and you don't want it to give a biased answer based on YOUR health stats. So you could "switch off" that category of context for the next time you send a query to any LLM using RAG. What could you call this feature? I want an intuitive name for it that describes the context well. Kind of like how I described my prompt engineering idea as "humors"
```

**

An intuitive and descriptive name for the feature of toggling contextual data on and off could be "Filters" or "Lenses", but here are some more creative suggestions aligned with the vision of ContextCore:

### 1. "Focus Modes"

- Highlights the idea of narrowing or expanding the AI's perspective based on what contexts are active.
    
- Intuitive for users to understand that they are focusing the AI’s “attention” on specific categories.
    

### 2. "Context Tuning"

- Suggests fine-tuning the contextual information to match the user's needs for a specific query.
    
- Implies precision and control without being overly technical.
    

### 3. "Perspectives"

- Captures the idea that turning off contexts provides a fresh or unbiased perspective.
    
- Resonates with users seeking alternative viewpoints in their queries.
    

### 4. "Scopes"

- Evokes the imagery of focusing on or excluding certain areas of context, much like a microscope or telescope.
    
- Simple and clear for users.
    

### 5. "Frames"

- References “framing” the AI’s understanding or response based on selected context categories.
    
- Conveys the idea of switching the lens through which the AI interprets the query.
    

### 6. "Context Shards"

- Suggests breaking down user-provided context into modular, toggleable pieces.
    
- Evocative of control over complex systems.
    

### 7. "Bias Blockers"

- Speaks directly to the value proposition: preventing bias by turning off specific contextual influences.
    
- Clear and user-friendly, especially for those aiming for objectivity.
    

### 8. "Context Filters"

- Emphasizes the ability to filter in or out certain categories of contextual information.
    
- Familiar terminology for most users and aligns with digital interaction paradigms.
    

### 9. "Neutral Zones"

- Highlights the ability to step into a “neutral” mode by excluding specific biases or contexts.
    
- Has a calming, decision-making feel.
    

### 10. "Insight Modes"

- Suggests the feature is a tool for gaining specific insights by manipulating active contexts.
    
- Adds a layer of empowerment to the user.
    

### Recommendation

I’d lean toward “Focus Modes” or “Context Filters” because they balance clarity, intuition, and a sense of control.

Would you like any of these refined further, or do you have a particular style or vibe in mind?

**

```
**I want the vibe to be something more personal and more unique. I like humors because it's an interesting esoteric system that almost seems mystical and adds a sense of fun to ContextCore. I'd like the "Focus Modes" concept to have a fun name as well.**
```

Got it! Let’s aim for something personal, unique, and slightly whimsical, like "Humors," but tied to the idea of focus or perspective. Here are some ideas with that mystical and fun vibe you're looking for:

- Suggests pulling back or layering veils to reveal or obscure certain parts of the AI’s perspective.
    
- Evocative of mystery and choice, fitting the esoteric tone.
    

### 2. "Facets"

- Like a gemstone, facets represent different angles or perspectives you can toggle on and off.
    
- Unique, elegant, and gives a sense of customization.

- Suggests weaving together (or unraveling) threads of context to create a tailored response.
    
- Adds depth and a sense of craftsmanship.
    

### 5. "Lenses"

- Mystical and soothing, adding to the charm of the feature.
    

### 8. "Prisms"

- You pass queries through specific prisms to filter or enhance the data context, creating a more refined output.
    
- Unique and visual, resonating with the idea of focused clarity.
    

### 9. "Masks"

- Playfully suggests concealing certain contexts to see how the AI responds differently, like donning or removing a mask.

### 10. "Filters of Fate"

### Recommendation

If you want something simple yet evocative, "Veils" or "Facets" fit beautifully. If you prefer a more playful and mystical tone, "Tides" or "Filters of Fate" could be intriguing.

Which of these feels most in line with your vision for ContextCore?

1. Veils

- Referring to long periods of time or epochs in ancient traditions, "Aeons" could imply switching between different dimensions or states of time (contexts).
    

17. Portals  
      
    

- Portals often represent gateways to other worlds or states of being, which fits well with the idea of opening and closing contexts based on the user's needs.
    

19. Essences  
      
    

- "Essences" suggests the fundamental nature or core of something, which could fit the idea of selecting which aspects of your context are activated.
