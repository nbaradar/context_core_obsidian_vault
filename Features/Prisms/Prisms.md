> Called Prism because all the configurations converge into 1 sentience like a "beam of light" granting concioussness to LLM models 
## Description
Allows users to save different configuration profiles. 

So let’s say for instance I want to get dietary advice specifically from the rock, but I also want the rock to be motivating and assertive
- **EXAMPLE**: I can create a Prism called “Angry Rock Trainer” or something
- **Contexts**: Health, AppleHealth, Fitness, Workouts, Diet, Nutrition, Activity, Sleep
- **Humors**: Angry, Motivating, Assertive
- **Mimics**: Dwayne the rock Johnson

**YOU CAN ALSO AUTOMATE SCHEDULING OF PRISMS.** 
So you can set your “Professional Assistant” prism to automatically take effect between 9am-5pm, and then switch to “Angry Rock Trainer” prism from 5pm-6pm.
