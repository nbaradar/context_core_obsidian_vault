You've got a great start with your project's vision and conceptual outline. Now it's time to move into the more concrete planning and execution phases. There's no single "right" way, but a common and effective approach for independent developers involves a combination of the things you mentioned, generally in this order:

1. Proof of Concept (POC) / Prototype: This is often the most crucial next step. Before diving into full-scale architecture or technology decisions, build a small, functional prototype that demonstrates the core functionality of your project.  
      
    

- Focus on the Riskiest Assumption: Identify the biggest technical or feasibility risk in your project. The POC should aim to validate (or invalidate) that assumption.
    
- Keep it Simple: The POC doesn't need to be polished or feature-complete. Focus on the core mechanics.
    
- Benefits:
    

- Validates feasibility early on.
    
- Helps you understand technical challenges.
    
- Provides a tangible demonstration for yourself and others.
    
- Informs your architecture and technology choices.
    

3. Technology Selection and Decision Matrix: Once you have a working POC, you'll have a better understanding of the technical requirements. Now is the time to make more concrete technology decisions.  
      
    

- Define Requirements: List the key requirements for each component of your project (e.g., database, backend language, frontend framework).
    
- Research Options: Explore different technologies that could meet those requirements.
    
- Create a Decision Matrix: This can be a simple table with criteria like:
    

- Performance
    
- Scalability
    
- Community support
    
- Learning curve
    
- Cost (if applicable)
    
- Existing skills within your team (if applicable)
    

- Benefits:
    

- Provides a structured approach to technology selection.
    
- Helps you compare and evaluate different options.
    
- Justifies your choices.
    

5. Architecture Design: With a better understanding of your technical requirements and chosen technologies, you can start designing the architecture of your project.  
      
    

- High-Level Diagram: Start with a high-level overview of the different components and how they interact.
    
- Component Diagrams: Create more detailed diagrams for individual components, showing their internal structure and interfaces.
    
- Data Flow Diagrams: Visualize how data flows through your system.
    
- Consider Scalability and Maintainability: Think about how your project might need to scale in the future and how you can make it easy to maintain and update.
    
- Benefits:
    

- Provides a blueprint for development.
    
- Helps you identify potential bottlenecks or design flaws.
    
- Facilitates communication with other developers (if applicable).
    

7. Detailed Design and Implementation: Now you can dive into the actual coding and implementation.  
      
    

- Break Down into Smaller Tasks: Divide the project into smaller, manageable tasks.
    
- Use Version Control (Git): Absolutely essential for managing your code and collaborating with others (even if you're working solo).
    
- Write Tests: Implement unit tests and integration tests to ensure the quality of your code.
    
- Iterate and Refine: Don't be afraid to revisit your design or technology choices as you learn more during development.
    

What Independent Developers Typically Do:

- Iterative Approach: They often follow an iterative process, starting with a small prototype and gradually adding features and refining the design.
    
- Focus on Practicality: They tend to prioritize practical solutions and avoid over-engineering.
    
- Leverage Existing Tools and Libraries: They often rely on open-source libraries and frameworks to accelerate development.
    
- Continuous Learning: They are constantly learning new technologies and adapting to the evolving landscape.
    

In your specific case:

Given you've already defined the vision, needs, and high-level functionality, I strongly recommend starting with a small POC. This will give you valuable insights and inform your subsequent technology choices and architecture design. Trying to design a full architecture before having a working prototype can lead to wasted effort if you discover fundamental technical issues later on.
