Yes, I believe this project is worth pursuing for several reasons:
1. Market Opportunity:
- The current LLM ecosystem lacks good solutions for context management across different providers
- Organizations increasingly need to work with multiple LLMs while maintaining consistent context
- The shift toward open-source AI tools creates demand for flexible frameworks

2. Unique Value:
- Your approach of separating the context management framework (ContextWeave) from the premium features (potential names like Akasha) is smart - it can build community through open source while maintaining a business model
- The focus on context portability between different LLMs addresses a real pain point
- The premium features you've proposed (Integrations, Humors, Mimics, Prisms) go beyond what existing tools offer

3. Timing:
- The market is mature enough to understand the need
- Organizations are actively looking for solutions in this space
- The technical infrastructure (vector databases, embedding models, etc.) has evolved to support this kind of system

4. Technical Feasibility:
- The core components we discussed (Context Store, RAG Pipeline, Query Interface) are well-understood patterns
- Existing technologies can be leveraged for the implementation
- The architecture can start simple and scale with demand

However, I would suggest focusing on these aspects for success:
1. Start with Rock-Solid Basics:
- Nail the core context management and RAG pipeline first
- Ensure excellent documentation and easy developer experience
- Build a strong testing framework

2. Community Building:
- Focus on making the open source framework truly valuable on its own
- Create clear contribution guidelines
- Build example implementations and use cases

3. Differentiation:
- Emphasize cross-LLM compatibility
- Focus on enterprise-ready features in the premium version
- Build strong data governance and security features
