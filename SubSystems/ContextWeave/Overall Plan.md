For now, what is the simplest form of ContextCore?
1. Database: We want to create a store of contextual information that is categorized. 
2. RAG: We want to feed the contextual information via RAG to any LLM
3. Query: We want to query the LLM with the RAG context available

---

## Open Source Philosophy

- Focus on Developer Adoption: Make the core infrastructure accessible and well-documented to attract developers and researchers.
    
- Encourage Extensions: Allow third-party developers to build plugins and extensions (e.g., integrations for specific tools like Notion or Slack).
    
- Maintain Transparency: Use MIT or Apache 2.0 licensing to encourage contributions while protecting proprietary enhancements.
    

---

## Proprietary Extensions (Closed Source)

The closed-source version (ContextCore Pro) would build upon the open-source foundation by adding premium features like:

- Humors: Emotional modeling frameworks.
    
- Mimics: Persona-based AI simulation.
    
- Prisms/Focus: Workflow automation and profile-based optimizations.
    
- Advanced Integrations: Plug-and-play connections with third-party apps.
    

This dual approach ensures widespread adoption while reserving high-value features for monetization.

Your plan for the ContextCore MVP is solid and well-structured. It establishes the foundational components necessary to demonstrate the system's ability to store, retrieve, and leverage personalized context. Here's a more detailed breakdown and refinement of your plan:

---

## MVP Plan for ContextCore

### 1. Core Components

#### 1. Database - Context Store

Purpose:

- To maintain and organize a persistent database of context categorized by topic or type.
    

Key Features:

- Data Categorization: Organize context by tags or categories (e.g., “Relationships,” “Career,” “Preferences”).
    
- Flexibility: Enable additions, updates, and deletions for iterative refinement.
    
- Search Optimization: Preprocess and embed text for efficient retrieval.
    

Tech Stack Options:

- Database: SQLite (lightweight), PostgreSQL (scalable), or MongoDB (flexible schema).
    
- Embedding Store:
    

- Open-source: FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) or ChromaDB.
    
- Hosted: Pinecone, Weaviate, or Qdrant (if preferring managed solutions).
    

- Embedding Model: OpenAI’s text-embedding-ada-002 or local alternatives like Sentence-BERT.
    

---

#### 2. RAG Pipeline

Purpose:

- To retrieve relevant context based on the user’s query and dynamically feed it into the LLM prompt.
    

Key Steps:

1. Input Processing:
    

- Parse query into keywords or semantic embeddings.
    

3. Similarity Search:
    

- Find related data in the database using vector similarity (e.g., cosine similarity).
    

5. Prompt Construction:
    

- Combine retrieved context with the user query into a single augmented prompt for the LLM.
    

Tech Stack Options:

- Frameworks:
    

- LangChain (flexible pipelines for RAG).
    
- LlamaIndex (optimized for context-aware retrieval).
    

- Embedding Models: Same as above.
    
- LLM Connectivity: OpenAI GPT API, or local models like LLaMA 2 or Mistral using Ollama or HuggingFace Transformers.
    

---

#### 3. Query Interface

Purpose:

- To allow users to interact with the system and ask questions using natural language.
    

Key Features:

- Input Field: Text input for user queries.
    
- Response Output: Render AI-generated responses in a chat-like format.
    
- Toggle Context (Shards):
    

- Allow users to select which categories of context should be active (e.g., “Relationships OFF,” “Career ON”).
    

Tech Stack Options:

- Frontend:
    

- Web-based: React, Next.js, or Streamlit (for rapid prototyping).
    
- CLI-based: Python (Flask/FastAPI for APIs).
    

- Backend APIs:
    

- Python (FastAPI or Flask for simplicity).
    

- LLM Connection: REST API calls to OpenAI GPT or any local model endpoint.
    

---

### 2. Development Steps

1. Set Up Database (Phase 1):  
      
    

- Design schema for categorized context storage.
    
- Create API endpoints for adding, updating, deleting, and querying context.
    
- Test with mock data.
    

3. Build RAG Pipeline (Phase 2):  
      
    

- Generate embeddings for the stored context.
    
- Implement similarity search using FAISS or Pinecone.
    
- Construct augmented prompts with retrieved context.
    

5. Integrate LLM Query Interface (Phase 3):  
      
    

- Build the user-facing interface (CLI or Web).
    
- Test API calls to LLM with and without context.
    

7. Testing and Iteration (Phase 4):  
      
    

- Add sample queries to test personalization.
    
- Fine-tune embedding search and prompt formatting.
    

---

### 3. Features to Demonstrate in MVP

1. Basic Query with Context:  
      
    

- Ask personal questions (e.g., “What advice would I give myself about career decisions?”).
    
- Demonstrate context retrieval affecting the LLM’s output.
    

3. Shard Switching (Context Filters):  
      
    

- Enable toggling specific contexts on/off to demonstrate flexibility.
    
- Example: Turning off relationship context to get an unbiased answer.
    

5. Extensibility for Future Features:  
      
    

- Highlight placeholders for adding Humors, Mimics, and Prisms later.
    

---

### 4. Optional Enhancements (if time permits)

- Multiple LLM Support:  
    Allow switching between APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Cohere, HuggingFace).
    
- Context Summarization:  
    Preprocess and condense stored context for efficiency.
    
- Local Model Hosting:  
    Experiment with running LLaMA 2 or Mistral locally using Ollama to showcase independence from third-party APIs.
    
- UI Enhancements:  
    Add history logs, export options, and a visual timeline of context updates.
    

---

### 5. Success Metrics for MVP

- Accuracy: Does the LLM give more personalized responses when context is enabled?
    
- Flexibility: Can users easily switch contexts and still receive meaningful answers?
    
- Scalability: Is the architecture ready to handle a growing database of information?
    

---

### Final Thoughts

This MVP plan provides a clear foundation to test the core premise of ContextCore—storing and feeding context dynamically while remaining private, flexible, and provider-agnostic.

Once the MVP is stable, you can layer in more advanced features like Mimics and Humors to enhance personalization and push the project closer to the philosophical AI assistant vision you’ve described.
