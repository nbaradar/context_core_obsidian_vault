Using tailwind involves downloading different tailwind component libraries. 

DO NOT use Bootstrap in combination with tailwind. 

Tailwind has a few component libraries already available. The most popular is [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/), but it requires lock-in. 

Instead, I will use [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) since there is no lock in, as they provide code for you to directly copy/paste into your codebase.

Will also use this Component written in shadcn/ui:

It is a chat component. very well developed.
