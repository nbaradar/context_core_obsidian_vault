### **What Is Axios?**
**Axios** is a popular JavaScript library for making HTTP requests from the browser or Node.js. It simplifies interactions with APIs, such as sending data via `POST` or retrieving data via `GET`.
### **Recommendation for ContextCore**
For ContextCore's **MultiQuery** frontend:
1. **Start with Axios**:
    - Its simplicity, features, and community support make it an excellent choice for most projects.
    - Youâ€™ll benefit from features like interceptors, which could streamline API integrations (e.g., managing tokens or logging).
2. **Reevaluate Later**:
    - As your project grows, you might want to integrate React Query for caching and state management. Axios can still be used under the hood with React Query, so you won't lose your initial setup.
