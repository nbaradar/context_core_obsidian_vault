The best way to interact with a MongoDB database in a **FastAPI** application is to use an **asynchronous MongoDB driver**, such as `motor`. It integrates seamlessly with FastAPI and allows for non-blocking database operations, which is important to maintain the responsiveness of your application.

> [!info]- Key Considerations
> 1. **Separation of Concerns:**
> 	- It is best practice to **separate the database interaction logic** into a service or utility module to ensure your code adheres to the **Single Responsibility Principle**.
> 	- Avoid putting CRUD operations directly into your endpoint handlers to keep them clean and focused on handling HTTP requests/responses.
> 2. **Insert Operation Responsibility:**
> 	- For the `/query` endpoint, it makes sense to log the result to the database **within the same request lifecycle**, especially if this is an essential feature of the endpoint (e.g., saving query history).
> 	- However, more complex database operations (e.g., retrieving a history of queries) should be handled by separate endpoints.
