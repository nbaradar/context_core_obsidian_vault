The best way to interact with a MongoDB database in a **FastAPI** application is to use an **asynchronous MongoDB driver**, such as `motor`. It integrates seamlessly with FastAPI and allows for non-blocking database operations, which is important to maintain the responsiveness of your application.

> [!info]- Key Considerations
> 1. **Separation of Concerns:**
> 	- It is best practice to **separate the database interaction logic** into a service or utility module to ensure your code adheres to the **Single Responsibility Principle**.
> 	- Avoid putting CRUD operations directly into your endpoint handlers to keep them clean and focused on handling HTTP requests/responses.
> 2. **Insert Operation Responsibility:**
> 	- For the `/query` endpoint, it makes sense to log the result to the database **within the same request lifecycle**, especially if this is an essential feature of the endpoint (e.g., saving query history).
> 	- However, more complex database operations (e.g., retrieving a history of queries) should be handled by separate endpoints.

# MongoDB Schema Design
This schema will support the [[Frontend Dev Notes#** MongoDB connection MongoDB Schema Design Refined Schema Design for This Data ** that was made using ChatGPT|plans for the front end]]
##### User Document

##### Chat Message Document

##### Chat Window Document
##### Chat Configs
Manage config details for a specific chat session (eg, LLM settings)
- **Design**: Embed these configurations directly in the `chat_window` document.
##### Results
Stores details about LLM responses and metadata
- **Design**: Embed result data in the `chat_message` document, as it is tightly coupled with each message.

```json

```

**users** stores user data, preferences, and linked chats
**chat_messages** stores individual messages and their associated results
**chat_windows** stores high-level chat session info
