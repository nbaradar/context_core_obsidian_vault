I want to start building the open source framework, ContextWeave. Can you help me design this framework? Here is what I'm currently thinking would be the first key components I'd need to build for a proof of concept:

1. A Context Store: This would be a centralized storage for structured and unstructured contextual data. It acts as the backbone for embeddings and metadata management.
2. A RAG Pipeline: Used to retrieve relevant context based on the user's query and dynamically feed it to the llm prompt
3. Query Interface: A way for the user to interact with an llm system and ask questions using natural language.

Does this seem like all the pieces I would need for a proof of concept where I store contextual information that can be leveraged by any llm when I want to query with my contextual data in mind?
```

This is a good starting point for a proof of concept, but let me suggest a slightly expanded architecture that would make the system more robust and extensible:

Core Components (your initial list plus some additions):
1. Context Store
   - Document storage
   - Vector storage for embeddings
   - Metadata management
   - Index management
   - Context versioning

2. RAG Pipeline
   - Document chunking
   - Embedding generation
   - Retrieval strategy
   - Context ranking/relevance scoring
   - Context window management
  
3. Query Interface
   - Query preprocessing
   - LLM provider abstraction layer
   - Response formatting
   - Context injection strategies
  
4. Additional Essential Components:
   - Configuration Management
     - LLM provider settings
     - Embedding model settings
     - Storage configurations
  
   - Plugin System
     - LLM provider adapters
     - Storage backend adapters
     - Embedding model adapters

  
Let me create a basic architecture diagram to show how these components would interact:

For a minimum viable proof of concept, I would suggest this implementation order:

  **1. First Phase:**
```
  - Basic Context Store with simple document storage  
  - Simple RAG pipeline with basic chunking and embedding  
  - Basic Query Interface with single LLM provider support**
```

**2. Second Phase:**
```
  - Add metadata management  
  - Improve retrieval with better ranking  
  - Add configuration management**
```

  **3. Third Phase:**
```
  - Implement plugin system  
  - Add support for multiple LLM providers  
  - Add advanced context injection strategies**
```
