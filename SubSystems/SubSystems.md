- **Key Features**:
    - Embedding-based search for semantic context retrieval.
    - Preprocessing pipeline to clean, tokenize, and embed data.
    - Context filtering through **ContextWeave** for precise query responses.
- **Role**: Powers personalized and contextually aware AI queries, forming the backbone of ContextCore’s functionality.

- **Key Features**:
    - **Humors**: Emotional tones (e.g., supportive, inquisitive, humorous) to influence responses.
    - **Mimics**: Persona-based behavior (e.g., emulate historical figures or archetypes).
    - **Prisms**: Workflow configurations combining contexts, Humors, and Mimics into reusable modes.
    - Scheduling for automatic Prism activation (e.g., “Work Mode” during office hours).
- **Role**: Provides transformative personalization and automation capabilities for power users and professionals.

---

#### 8. **Import/Export System**

- **Purpose**: Ensure data portability and interoperability across platforms.
- **Key Features**:
    - Import/export context as JSON or compressed formats (e.g., BLOBs).
    - Schema transformation for compatibility with external systems like ChatGPT or local models.
    - Batch and partial exports for fine-grained control.
- **Role**: Supports user data sovereignty and seamless migration between systems.

---

#### 9. **User Interface (Dashboard)**

- **Purpose**: Centralized UI for managing all ContextCore subsystems.
- **Key Features**:
    - CRUD operations for contexts and prompts.
    - Visual toggles for ContextWeave elements and conversation history.
    - MultiQuery result comparison and analysis tools.
    - Advanced configuration for Akasha features (e.g., Prism scheduling).
- **Role**: Makes ContextCore accessible to non-technical users while exposing advanced customization for power users.

---

#### 10. **Analytics and Insights**

- **Purpose**: Provide actionable insights to optimize user workflows and AI interactions.
- **Key Features**:
    - Usage statistics for contexts, prompts, and conversations.
    - Recommendations for context optimizations and new feature adoption.
    - Query performance metrics (e.g., token usage, retrieval efficiency).
- **Role**: Helps users refine their ContextCore setup and maximize value.

---

#### 11. **Integrations Subsystem (Planned for Future)**

- **Purpose**: Automate ingestion of external data sources into the **Context Store**.
- **Key Features**:
    - APIs for connecting platforms like Slack, Notion, Apple Health, or financial tools.
    - Real-time updates for dynamic context enrichment.
    - Multimodal data support (e.g., images, audio, text).
- **Role**: Expands ContextCore’s versatility by seamlessly incorporating external data streams.

---

#### 12. **Marketplace (Planned for Long-Term)**

- **Purpose**: Enable users to share, sell, or download Humors, Mimics, Prisms, and prompts.
- **Key Features**:
    - Community-driven repository of advanced customization tools.
    - Rating and review systems for shared items.
    - Collaborative features for co-creating templates or personas.
- **Role**: Builds a vibrant ecosystem around ContextCore, encouraging innovation and engagement.
