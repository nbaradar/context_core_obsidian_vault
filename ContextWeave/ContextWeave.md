### ContextWeave: ContextCore Open Source Framework
What it Does:  
ContextMesh is an open-source framework for context management, enabling AI systems to dynamically adapt based on user-defined data, states, and preferences. It provides tools for storing, querying, and activating context data to deliver more personalized and context-aware responses.

Core Features:
- Context Database: Stores structured and unstructured data for AI memory.
- Dynamic Context Switching: Toggle contextual data on/off for different tasks.
- Import/Export Tools: Migrate context data across platforms and formats.
- Embeddings & Retrieval Pipeline: Uses vector search to retrieve relevant context in real time.
- APIs for Integration: Connects easily to LLMs and external systems.

### Use Cases:
1. Personal AI Assistant  
- Goal: Build an AI that remembers user preferences and adapts responses based on current tasks.
- How: Use context switching to activate specific datasets (e.g., "Work Mode" or "Casual Mode").
- Example: A chatbot toggles between formal and casual tones depending on the context shard selected.

3. Customizable Customer Support Bot  
- Goal: Create a support bot that dynamically retrieves product knowledge based on customer queries.
- How: Use embeddings to index product manuals and switch contexts based on user inputs.
- Example: A user asking about "Model X Warranty" triggers context focused only on warranty details, excluding unrelated data.

5. Research Assistant for Developers  
- Goal: Provide code examples and explanations based on project-specific configurations.
- How: Import relevant codebases as context and enable context toggles for different programming languages.
- Example: Switching between Python and Java contexts provides language-specific recommendations.

7. Interactive Storytelling or Role-Playing Games  
- Goal: Develop AI-driven RPGs where the AI adapts its behavior based on character roles and emotional states.
- How: Use Mimics for personas and Humors for emotional shifts during gameplay.
- Example: An NPC responds differently based on the playerâ€™s mood or past interactions stored in context.
